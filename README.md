# README

This is a data science project that made use of a dataset containing information about guinea pig tooth growth and its relation to the consumption of vitamin C. In this project, I have made use of tools like R (ggplot2), RStudio, RMarkdown,  statistical inference, regression models, git and github pages. The full report can be accessed [here](https://mateusmelo821.github.io/Guinea-Pig-Toothgrowth-Analysis/).
